I got annoyed searching for a *useable* network filesystem with local caching,
and disconnected operation. So I hacked this redneck style bash script.

This prototype uses sshfs and unionfs-fuse. Other setups (nfs, overlayfs) may
be possible, but are not topic yet. Using fuse based filesystem has some
advantages for developing as well drawback because of limited/lacking
features. Bear with it. Nevertheless it aims to be useable as in making sure
that no data gets lost or corrupted.


== Features (some are planned)

- Cache everything locally
- Have a garbagge collector which manages the local cache
- Pinning files locally
- Disconnected operation with detached files and merging them later
- Transparent data storage. If everything breaks, there are still plain files
  on the disk!


== Plan

- Make it useable ASAP


== Howto

Read the source, Luke.
